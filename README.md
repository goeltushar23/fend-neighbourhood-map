  ```bash
  $> npm install
  $> bower install
  $> gulp build
  $> gulp
  ``` 

3. To Run Simply just Navigate to /path/to/your-project-folder/dist and open `index.html` in browser

4. To inspect the site on your desktop/phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> node server.js
  ```

5. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
6. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```
